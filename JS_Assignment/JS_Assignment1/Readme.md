# Drum Kit

Welcome to the "Drum Kit" task! This project involves creating a virtual drum kit where you can play different drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keyboard keys. The sounds used for the drums will be sourced from [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/) website.

## Task Description

In this Project i had build a web application that simulates a drum kit. The application should have the following features:

- A set of buttons that represent different drums (e.g., snare drum, bass drum, hi-hat, etc.).
- When a button is clicked or a corresponding keyboard key is pressed, the respective drum sound should play.
- Drum sounds should be sourced from [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/) website. Choose different drum sounds for each drum type.
- Provide a visual representation of the drum set, either through images or stylized buttons.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API for fetching drum sounds from Mixkit

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Click on the drum buttons or use the corresponding keyboard keys to play the drum sounds.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the application, such as:
- Click on the drum buttons to play the corresponding drum sound.
- Alternatively, you can use the keyboard keys associated with each drum to trigger the sounds.

## Attribution

Make sure to give proper attribution to the drum sounds you're using from Mixkit. For example:
